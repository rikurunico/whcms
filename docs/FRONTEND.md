# WHCMS — Frontend Guide

> Binding frontend architecture guide. Read with docs/CONTRACTS.md (§9 API surface, §13 frontend contract) and the
> scaffold code on disk under `frontend/src/` (hooks.server.ts, lib/server/api.ts, lib/components/, lib/i18n/).
> Backend DTO field names = JSON tags in `backend/internal/domain/entities.go` wrapped in the httpx envelope
> `{data, meta, error}`; list meta = `{page, per_page, total}`. Read entities.go to type responses.

## 0. Chassis rules

- **Ownership**: feature work stays inside its route group (§2) and its own `src/lib/i18n/messages/<area>.ts`
  namespace file. The shared chassis — package.json/lock (no new npm deps without a deliberate decision),
  hooks.server.ts, lib/server/*, lib/components/*, lib/i18n/{id,en,i18n.svelte,index}.ts, app.css, root
  layouts — changes only in focused cross-cutting commits, never forked locally inside a feature.
- **Data flow**: `+page.server.ts` `load` via `apiFetch(event, '/api/v1/...')` → returns `{data, meta, error, status}`
  (never throws; `unwrap()` to throw). Mutations = form `actions` (progressive enhancement `use:enhance`), success →
  toast (`$lib/stores/toast.svelte`) or redirect; failure → `fail(status, { errorKey | errorMessage, values })`
  matching the login page pattern. Client-side polling allowed ONLY where specified via a colocated `+server.ts` proxy.
- **Components**: use the scaffold design system (DataTable server-mode with `?page=` URL state, StatusBadge,
  MoneyText for EVERY amount, DateText for every date, Modal/ConfirmDialog for destructive actions, FormField,
  Tabs, StatCard, EmptyState, LoadingButton, Alert, Breadcrumb). Svelte 5 runes only ($props/$state/$derived,
  function bindings for FormField value). No `export let`.
- **i18n**: ALL user-visible strings through `t('...')`. Add keys ONLY in your own
  `src/lib/i18n/messages/<agent>.ts` (default export `{ id: {...}, en: {...} }`, deep-merged; namespace your keys
  under a unique top-level key, e.g. `orderfe.cart.title`). Bahasa Indonesia primary, English complete.
- **data-testid**: every page's primary interactive elements and key data displays get stable `data-testid`
  attributes (kebab-case: `invoice-status`, `pay-button`, `domain-search-input`, `ticket-reply-submit`, table rows
  `row-<entity>-<id>`). E2E depends on these.
- **Errors/empty/loading**: every list has EmptyState; every load handles `error` (Alert with message); actions show
  field errors under inputs.
- **WHMCS look**: dense tables, breadcrumbs, tabbed detail pages, KPI cards; blue accents; badge colors:
  green=active/paid, yellow=pending/unpaid, red=overdue/suspended/terminated, gray=cancelled.
- **Gate**: `npm run check` and `npm run build` with zero errors, and every new user-facing flow ships its own
  Playwright spec (CLAUDE.md §5). If an API shape is unclear, read the backend DTOs — don't guess; when frontend
  and backend disagree on a shape, reconcile per `docs/RECONCILE.md`.
- Smoke-test against the real stack (`make up`) — contract fidelity plus the E2E suite is the bar, not
  "looks right in isolation".

## 1. Shared conventions

- Pagination: DataTable reads `?page=&per_page=`; loads forward those to the API and return `meta`.
- Filters/search: querystring-driven (`?search=&status=`), form GET.
- Client guard: `(client)` layout already redirects anonymous → /login?redirect=. Admin: role guard exists;
  staff-permission hiding: nav shows what `locals.user.role==='admin'` OR permission map allows — keep simple:
  render all for admin, all for staff too (backend enforces; UI hiding is best-effort P2).
- Payment status colors + labels via StatusBadge semantic map (already in scaffold).
- Forms for money input: plain number inputs (IDR, no decimals), display via MoneyText.
- 2FA setup: display secret + otpauth:// URI as copyable text (NO QR — no new deps).
- Reports charts: pure CSS/SVG bars (no chart libs).

## 2. Route map by area (routes under frontend/src/routes; each area has its own i18n namespace file)

### FE-AUTH — `(public)/register`, `(public)/verify-email`, `(public)/forgot-password`, `(public)/reset-password`
Register: full form (email, password+confirm, first/last name, company?, address, city, postcode, country default ID,
phone) → POST /api/v1/auth/register → success page "check your email" (+ resend button → /auth/resend-verification).
Verify-email: reads ?token= → POST /auth/verify-email → success → auto-login? No: link to /login with success alert.
Forgot: email → POST /auth/forgot-password (always success message). Reset: ?token= + new password →
POST /auth/reset-password → redirect /login. All with proper error surfacing (expired token etc.).

### FE-ORDER — `(public)/order/**`, `src/lib/stores/cart.svelte.ts`
`/order`: product groups + product cards (GET /products, /product-groups) w/ pricing per cycle.
`/order/product/[slug]`: configure (cycle select w/ prices, configurable options, domain input: register-new
(availability check POST /domains/check debounced) | transfer (epp later) | own-domain), add to cart.
`/order/domain`: standalone domain search (multi-TLD result list, prices, add register/transfer to cart).
`/order/cart`: items list, remove, coupon apply (POST /coupons/validate), totals w/ tax preview (client-side calc
display only; server is source of truth), proceed → if !locals.user: inline login/register panel (reuse auth
endpoints; on register instruct email verification; block checkout until verified — show state clearly);
checkout submit → POST /api/v1/orders → redirect `/billing/invoices/<invoice_id>` (client area) to pay.
Cart store: $state in localStorage-persisted rune store (guard browser), items typed per CONTRACTS order input.

### FE-CLIENT-CORE — `(client)/dashboard`, `(client)/account/**`, owns `(client)/+layout.svelte` nav polish
Dashboard: StatCards (active services, domains, unpaid invoices w/ total, open tickets — from list endpoints w/
per_page=1 meta.total or a summary endpoint if present), recent invoices table, quick links.
Account: tabs Profile (PATCH profile fields), Security (change password; 2FA setup/enable/disable via /auth/2fa/*),
Contacts (CRUD sub-accounts w/ permission checkboxes), Credit (balance display + ledger table + link deposit).
Client nav: Home/Services/Domains/Billing/Support/Account + locale switcher + logout (keep existing structure).

### FE-CLIENT-SERVICES — `(client)/services/**`
List: DataTable (product name, domain, price MoneyText, next due, status). Detail `[id]`: overview card (product,
domain, server?, dates, recurring), actions: change password (modal, POST /services/:id/change-password), SSO
(GET /services/:id/sso → open url new tab), cancel (modal immediate|end_of_term → POST /services/:id/cancel),
upgrade (pick product+cycle → POST upgrade endpoint → redirect to created invoice), renewal invoice link if unpaid.

### FE-CLIENT-DOMAINS — `(client)/domains/**`
List: DataTable (domain, registrar status badge, expiry DateText, auto-renew toggle inline PATCH). Detail `[id]`:
tabs Overview (dates, status, renew now → POST /domains/:id/renew → redirect invoice), Nameservers (2-4 inputs,
PATCH), DNS (records table editor: type select A/AAAA/CNAME/MX/TXT/NS, host, value, TTL, prio; add/edit/delete
rows client-side then PUT full set), EPP (reveal button GET /domains/:id/epp shows code copyable), Contact
(registrant form PATCH).

### FE-CLIENT-BILLING — `(client)/billing/**`, `(public)/payments/return`
`/billing`: tabs Invoices (DataTable: number, date, due, total, status; filter status) + Transactions (history) +
link deposit. Invoice detail `/billing/invoices/[id]`: WHMCS-style invoice view (company block from settings? just
render invoice fields; items table, subtotal/discount/tax/credit/total), status banner, PDF download (link
/api/v1/invoices/:id/pdf via proxy +server.ts streaming), IF unpaid/overdue: payment panel — methods grid (GET
/payments/methods?invoice_id=, icons+fees), pay button → POST /invoices/:id/pay {method} → render result: redirect
paymentUrl if present, else show VA number / QR string (copyable) + amount + expiry; credit balance option when
sufficient (method credit). Status POLLING while unpaid: colocated `+server.ts` GET returning {status} (proxies
GET /invoices/:id), client interval 4s, on paid → invalidate + success toast. `/billing/deposit`: amount form
(min 10000) → POST /account/credit/deposit → redirect invoice. `/payments/return`: reads ?merchantOrderId= — page
calls its own +server.ts proxy hitting GET /api/v1/payments/return mapping → then redirects to the invoice page
(or shows "payment processing" with link).

### FE-CLIENT-SUPPORT — `(client)/support/**`
List (status filter tabs), `/support/new` (department select GET /ticket-departments, subject, priority, message,
file input multi w/ ext/size hints; multipart POST /tickets), detail `[id]`: thread (replies chronological,

## 3. Client/Public theme — Twenty-One (`.ca`)

The `(public)/**` and `(client)/**` areas render in a **WHMCS "Twenty-One" theme** (see `DESIGN-FRONT.md`),
the client-side analogue of the admin HostPanel theme. This **supersedes** the earlier "client/public stay
Tailwind" guidance (§0/§1) — it was deliberately changed to match real WHMCS.

- **Theme CSS** `frontend/src/lib/styles/twentyone.css` — all rules scoped under `.ca` (tokens on that class;
  primary `#336699`, success `#218739`, body `#F1F1F1`, radius `3.5px`, container `1140px`, Open Sans; mobile-first
  576/768/992/1200). It re-tints the reused shared components by overriding `--color-*`/`font-family` inside `.ca`
  only — **do not edit the shared components' internals** (admin relies on their untouched Tailwind globals).
- **Shell** `frontend/src/lib/components/ca/*` + `nav.ts`: `CaShell` (loads Open Sans + Font Awesome via CDN,
  wraps content in `.ca`, variants portal/auth/store/client), `CaHeader`, `CaNav`, `CaBreadcrumb`, `CaFooter`,
  `CaLanguageModal`, `CaPanel`, `CaProductCard`, `CaTile`, `CaStoreSidebar`, `CaOrderSummary`, `CaDomainHero`, `CaPrice`.
- **Keep the E2E contract**: reuse `FormField` (`id="field-<name>"`), `DataTable` (real `<table>`), `StatusBadge`
  (word text), `Modal`/`ConfirmDialog` (`role="dialog"`, confirm last), `Toast`, `MoneyText`, `DateText`; preserve all
  `data-testid`s/form `action`s/input `name`s and success-toast copy. Money: `MoneyText` where already used; `CaPrice`
  (`Rp… IDR`) for new store/hero prices.
- **i18n**: new client strings in `messages/portal.ts` (`portal.*`); admin-portal strings in `messages/fe-admin-portal.ts`
  (`adminPortal.*`). Never edit `id.ts`/`en.ts`.
- **New public routes**: `/` = portal Home (anon; authed users redirect to `/dashboard`/`/admin`), `/announcements`
  (+`/[slug]`), `/knowledgebase` (+`/category/[slug]`, `/article/[slug]`, `?search=`), `/network-status`, `/contact`.
  Backed by the announcements/knowledgebase/networkstatus/contact API groups (CONTRACTS §9). Admin management for
  these lives under `(admin)/admin/{announcements,knowledgebase,network-status}` in the `hp-*` theme.
