# CLAUDE.md — WHCMS engineering guide

Guidance for any developer or AI agent adding features to this repo. Read this
first, then the authoritative docs it points to. **When this file and the code
disagree, trust the code and fix this file.**

WHCMS (Web Hosting Central Management System) is a **WHMCS-clone billing & automation platform** for hosting
providers: client management, product catalog, orders, IDR invoicing, Duitku
payments, automatic cPanel/DirectAdmin provisioning, RDash domain management,
support tickets, and a WHMCS-style admin + client area. Go API + SvelteKit BFF.

---

## 0. Golden rules (do not violate)

1. **Backend coverage must stay > 90%.** `make test-backend` enforces it and fails the build below the threshold. New exported functions need tests. (See §5.)
2. **Money is IDR-only, `int64` whole rupiah**, DB `BIGINT`. Never floats for money. Currency defaults to `'IDR'`.
3. **Secrets never touch source control, plaintext DB columns, or API responses.** Most module secrets (SMTP, CAPTCHA, etc.) are environment-only. The RDash registrar and Duitku gateway API keys are the exception: admin-configurable dynamically (no restart) via `AES-256-GCM`-encrypted `*_enc` columns/settings (`ports.Encryptor`), decrypted ad-hoc at the call site — env vars remain the fallback for whichever field is left blank, and no endpoint ever echoes back a stored key or its ciphertext, only a `*_present` boolean. The RDash base URL (`registrars.base_url`, a plain non-secret "custom endpoint" override — e.g. to point at the mockserver instead of production without restarting) follows the same dynamic/env-fallback pattern, just unencrypted. See `docs/CONTRACTS.md` §5, §10, §11.
4. **Respect the ownership/layering map** in [`docs/CONTRACTS.md`](docs/CONTRACTS.md) §1. `docs/CONTRACTS.md` is the **binding architecture contract** — align to it; don't redefine enums, envelopes, or signatures.
5. **The HTTP envelope is fixed**: success `{"data":…,"meta":…|null,"error":null}`, error `{"data":null,"error":{"code","message","details"}}`. Pagination `?page=&per_page=` (default 1/10, max 1000). Every paginated list in the UI must offer a page-size selector with options 10/25/50/100/500/1000, defaulting to 10.
6. **Never break the E2E contract, and every new frontend flow ships its own E2E test.** Preserve every `data-testid`, form `action`, and field `name` the Playwright suite depends on (`frontend/tests/e2e/`), and add/extend a spec that drives any new user-facing feature/route/flow (the FE analog of the >90% backend gate — see §5). Run `make test-frontend` before claiming done on frontend work.
7. **Don't hand-edit generated/foundation-owned files** to route around a rule (router wiring, migrations history, `internal/ports/ports.go` signatures). Add migrations forward; don't rewrite applied ones.
8. **No global mutable state** in the backend; config is loaded once into `platform/config.Config` and injected. No `panic` in the request path.

## 1. Commands (root `Makefile` — run `make help`)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make up` | Start the full local stack: mockserver + api + seed + worker + frontend (wraps `scripts/e2e-up.sh`). |
| `make down` | Stop the local stack (wraps `scripts/e2e-down.sh`). |
| `make test-backend` | Backend `build` + `vet` + tests **with coverage, enforcing >90%** (wraps `backend/make cover-gate`). Needs a running Postgres; runs `migrate-up` first. |
| `make test-frontend` | Playwright E2E against the running stack (`make up` first). Filter: `make test-frontend SPEC=admin-ops.spec.ts`. |
| `make lint` | The exact lint set CI runs: gofmt + golangci-lint (backend), `go vet` (mockserver), e2e fixture-import guard. |
| `make hooks` | Install the repo git hooks — pre-push runs `make lint` (bypass once: `SKIP_LINT=1 git push`). |
| `make test` | `lint`, then `test-backend`, then `test-frontend`. |

Prerequisites: Go ≥1.26, Node 22, and locally-running **PostgreSQL 18** (`postgres://root:postgres@localhost:5432/whmcs`), **Redis** (`:6379`), **RustFS/S3** (`:9000`, `rustfsadmin`/`rustfsadmin`, bucket `whmcs`). Full setup: [`README.md`](README.md) and [`docs/E2E.md`](docs/E2E.md). Seeded admin login: `admin@e2e.test` / `AdminE2E!2026`.

`whmcs` above is the developer's own **local** database — untouched by any test target. `make up`/`make test-backend` and every `_integration_test.go` instead default to a separate **`whmcs_e2e`** database on the same Postgres server (auto-created if missing), so running tests never resets or clobbers local manual-testing data (`docs/CONTRACTS.md` §11, `docs/E2E.md` §3). First-time local setup (creating/configuring the `whmcs` database, the first admin account) is handled by the installation wizard at `/install` — see `docs/CONTRACTS.md` §15 — rather than by a manual `createdb`/seed step.

Backend-only helpers (from `backend/`): `make build`, `make vet`, `make fmt`, `make test` (unit), `make cover` (unit coverage, no DB), `make cover-gate` (full >90% gate, needs PG), `make test-integration`, `make migrate-up`.

## 3. Backend — how to add or change a feature

Work as a **vertical slice inside `internal/modules/<mod>/`**. Typical order:

1. **Domain** (`internal/domain`): if you need a new entity/enum/state transition, add it here. Enum string values must match DB CHECK constraints (CONTRACTS §4). Prefer `CanTransition(from,to)` guards over ad-hoc status writes.
2. **Migration** (`backend/migrations`): add a new forward migration pair for schema changes. Never edit an applied migration. The API runs migrations on startup.
3. **Ports** (`internal/ports`): if a service needs a new capability, add the interface method here (foundation-owned; keep signatures minimal and `ctx`-first). Add/extend the fake in `internal/ports/mocks` (`Mock<Interface>`).
4. **Repo** (`<mod>/repo.go`): hand-written parameterized SQL via pgx (no ORM, no string interpolation). Add a `//go:build integration` test in `<mod>/repo_integration_test.go` against real PG.
5. **Service** (`<mod>/service.go`): use-case logic. Takes `ctx` first, returns `*apperr.Error` (codes: `VALIDATION, UNAUTHORIZED, FORBIDDEN, NOT_FOUND, CONFLICT, RATE_LIMITED, PAYMENT_REQUIRED, EXTERNAL, INTERNAL`). Unit-test with fakes of ports. Call `AuditLogger` for sensitive actions.
6. **DTO** (`<mod>/dto.go`): request/response structs with `validate:` tags; validate via `platform/validate.Struct`.
7. **Handler** (`<mod>/handler.go`): thin Fiber v3 handler — bind+validate DTO, call service, write via `httpx` envelope helpers. Read identity with `httpx.Identity(c)`. Never put business logic here.
8. **Wire it** in `internal/composition/build.go` and mount the module's `RegisterRoutes` in `cmd/api/main.go`. Protect admin routes with `RequireRole("admin","staff")` + `RequirePermission("<module>")`; client routes with `RequireClient` and **always filter queries by `client_id` from the token**.
9. **Test to keep coverage > 90%** (§5), then `make test-backend`.

Key conventions (full list: CONTRACTS §3): `int64` IDs/money; `TIMESTAMPTZ`/UTC internally; soft-delete only on `clients`/`products`/`product_groups`; Redis key prefix `whmcs:`; idempotent payment activation via row lock + partial unique index + status check (never trust a callback alone — confirm via Check Transaction); adapters log every external call via `IntegrationLogger` with secrets redacted.

---

## 4. Frontend — how to add or change a feature

- **BFF only.** The browser never calls the Go API directly. SvelteKit `load`/actions call the API server-side via `$lib/server/api.ts` (`apiFetch`), which attaches the Bearer token from httpOnly cookies and unwraps the envelope into `{data, meta, error}`. `locals.user` comes from `/auth/me`.
- **Route groups** (`frontend/src/routes`): `(public)` (login/register/order/payments), `(client)` (guarded), `(admin)` (guarded, role admin/staff). Each page = `+page.server.ts` (load + form `actions`) + `+page.svelte`. Guards live in the group `+layout.server.ts`.
- **Svelte 5 runes**: `$props`, `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`. TypeScript strict. Prefer server-side `load` over client fetches; use `use:enhance` for form actions.
- **Money**: `Intl.NumberFormat('id-ID',{style:'currency',currency:'IDR',maximumFractionDigits:0})` (or `MoneyText`). **Dates**: Asia/Jakarta.
- **i18n**: `$lib/i18n`, `t('key')`, dictionaries `id`/`en` (default `id`). New client/public strings go through `t()`.
- **Preserve `data-testid`s, form `action`s, and field `name`s** — the Playwright suite keys on them. If you must change one, update the spec in the same change and re-run `make test-frontend`.

### Admin UI theme — HostPanel (WHMCS "blend")

The `(admin)/admin/**` area uses a **dedicated WHMCS-blend theme called HostPanel**, separate from the Tailwind/Inter look of the client & public areas. (This supersedes the older admin-design note in CONTRACTS §13.)

- Theme CSS: `frontend/src/lib/styles/hostpanel.css` — **every rule is scoped under `.hp-admin`** (set on the admin layout root) so it never leaks into client/public. Palette: navy `#1A4D80` chrome, `#337AB7` primary; status green `#46A546` / yellow `#F89406` / red `#C43C35` / gray `#BFBFBF`.
- Shell components: `frontend/src/lib/components/hp/` — `HpNavbar`, `HpSidebar`, `HpFooter`, `HpPanel`, `HpStatCard`, `HpModal`, and `nav.ts` (top-menu model + `sidebarKind(pathname)` contextual sidebar + `pageTitle(pathname)`).
- Font Awesome 6 + Open Sans are loaded via CDN `<link>` in the admin `+layout.svelte` `<svelte:head>` (admin routes only).
- When adding/rethemeing an admin page: use the `hp-*` classes (`hp-table`, `hp-panel`, `hp-btn`/`hp-btn-primary`, `hp-badge`, `hp-input`/`hp-select`, `hp-filter`, `hp-pager`, `hp-formrow`, `hp-tabs`…), keep the existing `+page.server.ts` load/actions and all testids, and use English labels to match the theme. Admin uses `.hp-*`; the client/public areas use the Twenty-One `.ca` theme below — don't cross the two.

### Client/Public UI theme — Twenty-One (`.ca`)

The `(public)/**` and `(client)/**` areas use a **dedicated WHMCS "Twenty-One" theme** (per [`docs/DESIGN-FRONT.md`](docs/DESIGN-FRONT.md)). **This supersedes the earlier "client/public stay Tailwind" note** — that direction was deliberately changed to make the client area match real WHMCS.

- Theme CSS: `frontend/src/lib/styles/twentyone.css` — **every rule is scoped under `.ca`** (set on the shell root) so it never leaks into admin. Palette: primary `#336699`, success `#218739`, body `#F1F1F1`, breadcrumb `#E9ECEF`, footer `#404040`/`#EEEEEE`, radius `3.5px`, container `1140px`, Open Sans 14px. Mobile-first (breakpoints 576/768/992/1200).
- Shell components: `frontend/src/lib/components/ca/` — `CaShell`, `CaHeader` (logo + KB search + cart badge), `CaNav` (Store/Account dropdowns + "More" overflow + mobile drawer), `CaBreadcrumb`, `CaFooter` + `CaLanguageModal`, `CaPanel`, `CaProductCard`, `CaTile`, `CaStoreSidebar`, `CaOrderSummary`, `CaDomainHero`, `CaPrice`, and `nav.ts`. Open Sans + Font Awesome 6 load via CDN `<link>` in `CaShell` `<svelte:head>`.
- **Reuse the shared contract-owning components** (`FormField`, `DataTable`, `StatusBadge`, `Modal`, `ConfirmDialog`, `Toast`, `MoneyText`, `DateText`) — they are re-tinted by scoped `--color-*`/font overrides inside `.ca`, NOT edited (admin depends on their untouched globals). Use `.ca-*` classes / `Ca*` components for chrome; `CaPrice` for new store/hero prices (`Rp… IDR`), `MoneyText` elsewhere.
- i18n for new client strings lives in `frontend/src/lib/i18n/messages/portal.ts` (`portal.*`); admin-portal strings in `fe-admin-portal.ts` (`adminPortal.*`). Don't edit `id.ts`/`en.ts`.
- The public **portal Home** is served at `/` for anonymous visitors (`(public)/+page.*`); authenticated users redirect to `/dashboard` (client) or `/admin` (staff). Portal features: `/announcements`, `/knowledgebase`, `/network-status`, `/contact` (backed by the announcements/knowledgebase/networkstatus/contact backend modules); admin-managed under `(admin)/admin/{announcements,knowledgebase,network-status}` (`hp-*` theme).

---

## 5. Testing & the >90% coverage gate (mandatory)

- **Backend gate (CONTRACTS §14):** total statement coverage over `internal/...` + `pkg/...` must stay **> 90%**. `make test-backend` runs `build` + `vet` + the full test suite with coverage and **fails below 90%** (override `COVERAGE_MIN=95`). Inspect gaps with `backend/coverage.html`.
- The **repository layer is integration-tested** (`//go:build integration`) against real Postgres, so the gate runs unit + integration together and needs a migrated DB (the target runs `migrate-up`). Unit-only (`cd backend && make cover`) is faster but does **not** reach 90% on its own.
- Test style (CONTRACTS §3): table-driven + testify; services with hand-written fakes of ports (shared in `internal/ports/mocks`, `Mock<Interface>`); adapters with `httptest.Server`; handlers with a Fiber app + mocked services; repos with integration-tagged tests. **Every exported function needs coverage.**
- **Frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run check` (svelte-check, must be 0 errors) + `npm run build` green; `make test-frontend` (Playwright, 8 critical flows per PRD §13.2) green against the live stack + mockserver.
- **E2E specs import `{ test, expect }` from `./fixtures`, never from `@playwright/test`** — the shared fixture's `page.goto` waits for SvelteKit hydration (`<html data-hydrated>`); without it, a spec's first click races hydration on slow machines and fails only in CI. `make lint` / `make test-frontend` enforce this. If a form submit may fall back to a native post (its click can race hydration too), call `waitForHydration(page)` before driving pure-JS controls on the resulting document.
- **Every new frontend feature/route/flow MUST ship its own Playwright E2E coverage** in `frontend/tests/e2e/` — add a new spec or extend an existing one to drive the new happy path (and key error/guard paths) end-to-end. Passing the existing suite without exercising the new behavior is **not** sufficient; new client/public/admin surfaces need `data-testid`s wired so the spec can key on them. This mirrors the backend rule "every exported function needs coverage" — for the frontend, **every new user-facing flow needs an E2E test.**

---

## 6. Definition of Done (checklist before you say it's finished)

- [ ] `make lint` clean (gofmt + golangci-lint + mockserver vet + e2e import guard — the same set CI runs).
- [ ] Backend: `make test-backend` passes (build + vet + tests, **coverage ≥ 90%**).
- [ ] Frontend: `npm run check` and `npm run build` clean; `make test-frontend` passes (or the relevant `SPEC`).
- [ ] **New frontend feature/route/flow adds or extends its own Playwright E2E spec** in `frontend/tests/e2e/` (drives the new flow itself — not just passing the pre-existing suite).
- [ ] New/changed behavior is exercised end-to-end (drove the real flow, not just unit tests).
- [ ] Envelope, enums, error codes, and money/int64 rules honored; secrets from env only.
- [ ] Migrations are forward-only and idempotent; `.env.example` updated if a var was added.
- [ ] `data-testid`s / form actions preserved (or specs updated in the same change).
- [ ] Admin pages use the HostPanel `hp-*` theme; client/public use the Twenty-One `.ca` theme (§4) + `t()` i18n.
- [ ] No `panic` in request path, no global state, `gofmt`/idiomatic Go, no leftover P0 TODOs.
- [ ] Commits (when the user asks for one) use **Semantic / Conventional Commit** messages (§7).

---

## 7. Git & commit conventions (mandatory)

**Every commit message MUST follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) ("Semantic Commit") format.** This applies to all contributors, including AI agents.

- **Format:** `type(scope): subject` — e.g. `feat(billing): add proration on plan upgrade`.
  - **`type`** (required, lowercase) is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
  - **`scope`** (optional but preferred) names the affected area — usually a backend module (`auth`, `billing`, `orders`, `payments`, `provisioning`, `domains`, `tickets`, `clients`, `adminops`, `notifications`), or `frontend`, `admin`, `docs`, `deploy`, `mockserver`.
  - **`subject`**: imperative mood, lowercase start, **no trailing period**, ≤ ~72 chars ("add", not "added"/"adds").
- **Body** (optional, after a blank line): explain *what* and *why*, not *how*. Wrap at ~72 cols.
- **Breaking changes:** append `!` after the type/scope (`feat(orders)!: …`) and/or add a `BREAKING CHANGE: …` footer.
- **Trailers** (e.g. `Co-Authored-By: …`) go in the footer, below the semantic subject/body.
- Keep commits focused: one logical change per commit; don't mix a refactor with a feature.

Examples:
```
fix(payments): confirm Duitku callback via Check Transaction before activating
docs: add internal/worker and RECONCILE.md to the CLAUDE.md map
refactor(catalog)!: drop legacy price_float column from products

BREAKING CHANGE: products.price is now int64 rupiah only.
```

---

## 8. Gotchas

- **Fiber v3**: `fiber.Ctx` is an interface; bind with `c.Bind().Body(&x)`; middleware is `func(c fiber.Ctx) error`.
- Coverage looks low (~80%) if you run unit-only — that's expected; the repository package is only covered by integration tests. Use `make test-backend` / `make cover-gate` for the real number.
- `make test-frontend` fails fast with a hint if the API (`:8080`) is down — run `make up` first. Note: a stack started by `make up` in a detached/CI context may be reaped when its launching process exits.
- Local ports: PG `5432`, Redis `6379`, RustFS `9000`, mockserver `9090`, api `8080`, frontend dev `5173` (Docker frontend `3000`).
- Duitku/RDash secrets in dev must match the mockserver defaults (`DEMO`/`secretkey`, `RDASH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9090/v1`), or signature/auth checks fail.
